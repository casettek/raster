# Core Workflow

Use the smallest safe change that solves the request.

## Required sequence

1. Confirm target area (`crates/*`, `examples/*`, `docs/*`).
2. Implement focused changes only.
3. Run scoped validation first, then broader checks if needed.
4. Complete a spec touchpoint for non-trivial changes:
   - update `docs/specs/` when behavior/contracts/architecture/operations changed, or
   - record a justified no-op note.
   - For trivial one-off UI/content/polish tweaks, no spec touchpoint is required.

## Validation defaults

- Single-crate changes: `cargo check -p <crate> && cargo test -p <crate>`
- Cross-crate/shared changes: `cargo check --workspace && cargo test --workspace`
- Before merge for substantial Rust changes: `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`

## Guardrails

- Do not add dependencies unless required by the task.
- Avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
- Keep secrets out of code and docs; use environment variables.
- Prefer explicit types and deterministic behavior over implicit behavior.
