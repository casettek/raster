## Raster specs

These documents are the **canonical, code-adjacent specifications** for the `raster` repository.

### Layout

- `core/`: Raster Core specs, organized by pipeline phase:
  - `0-conventions/`
  - `1-define/`
  - `2-compile/`
  - `3-execute/`
  - `4-verify/`

### Relationship to the Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base keeps **summaries and pointers**. The full spec text lives here in the output repository so it can evolve alongside implementation.
