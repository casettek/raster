# Fibonacci Sequence Example

Demonstrates a sequence with conditional logic and loops.

## Structure

- `fib_step`: Computes the next Fibonacci pair
- `check_limit`: Verifies if we should continue
- `fibonacci_sequence`: A looping sequence with a conditional exit

## Running

```bash
cargo raster build
cargo raster run
cargo raster analyze
```

This example is useful for understanding:
- How to structure tiles with multiple inputs/outputs
- How sequences handle control flow
- How tracing captures loop iterations
